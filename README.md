# Silicone Optics - Cinematic Scrollytelling Experience

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **⚡ VIBECODED PROJECT**
> This entire experience was **Vibecoded** by the developer using **Antigravity**. From the initial concept to the final premium UI, the code was generated through a fluid, AI-assisted workflow.

A high-end, award-winning level landing page for "Silicone Optics," a fictional cinematic camera lens. This project features an immersive scrollytelling experience where a camera lens mechanically explodes and reassembles as the user scrolls, driven by a 240-frame high-fidelity image sequence.

## ✨ Features

- **Cinematic Scrollytelling**: 240-frame scroll-linked animation rendering at 60fps using HTML5 Canvas.
- **Premium UI Overhaul**: Fully integrated **HeroUI** component library with a custom minimal aesthetic.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Sleek, frosted-glass components for the navbar and feature cards.
- **Theme System**: Robust light/dark mode support with persistent preferences.
- **Precision Typography**: Huge, impactful typography (Inter font family) with scroll-triggered fade-in animations.
- **Performance Optimized**: Batch image pre-loading and efficient canvas rendering logic.

## 🎨 The Creative Process

The core visual component of this project—the exploding lens animation—was crafted using a cutting-edge Generative AI workflow:

1.  **Concept Generation**: Keyframes generated using **Google ImageFX**, establishing visual fidelity.
2.  **Motion Synthesis**: Utilized **Google Veo/Flow** to animate the explosion sequence.
3.  **Sequence Extraction**: Processed into a high-resolution 240-frame sequence.
4.  **⚡ Vibe Coding**: The entire web experience was built using a "Vibe Coding" methodology with **Antigravity**, transforming raw ideas into a polished, production-ready application with complex animations and modern UI components.
